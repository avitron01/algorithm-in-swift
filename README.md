# algorithm-in-swift

A collection of various algorithms written in swift (v4), primarly for learning purposes. It's still a work in progress. 

## Some of the algorithms implemented till now:
  ### Sorting algorithms
  - Bubble sort
  - Selection sort
  - Insertion sort

## Prerequisites
- Requires swift 4 compiler installed in you're system. For more info regarding installion, please visit: https://swift.org/getting-started/#installing-swift

## Usage 
For example, to run the SortingAlgorithm demo in terminal, write:
```
swift SortingAlgorithm.swift
```
